<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Abdulbasit 👋</h1>
<p align="center">Frontend Developer | Backend Learner @ ALX | Passionate about building impactful web experiences</p>

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a learner of the **ALX Backend Program**, with a solid foundation in **Frontend Development**  HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.

What got me started in Software Engineering was my curiosity to understand how things work on the web — from user interfaces to the logic behind them. I believe great design meets great code, and I strive to bridge that gap.

### ✨ What inspires me:
- Seeing real-world problems solved through simple, usable web interfaces  
- The power of communities and open-source  
- Learning in public and helping others grow along the way

## 🎯 My Vision

I want to become a **world-class fullstack developer** who builds scalable, accessible, and user-friendly applications.  
My aim is to **combine design and logic** to build tools that genuinely help people.

## ✨ Fun Fact
I started with frontend, but the more I built, the more curious I became about how things work under the hood  now, I’m here, diving into the backend one function at a time 💻🧠

## 🚀 Projects I’d Love to Work On
- Frontend apps that consume public APIs
- Fullstack portfolio projects (React + Django)
- Product landing pages and UI redesigns
- Open-source tools that simplify daily workflows
